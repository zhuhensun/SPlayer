//! Tauri bridge for the in-process NCM protocol layer.
//!
//! [`ncm_core::NcmCore`] is `Send + Sync` and internally async, so it lives
//! directly in Tauri state — no worker thread, no channel. JS execution inside
//! it is still serialized behind the QuickJS runtime lock, but the HTTP op
//! returns a real promise, so concurrent `ncm_request` calls overlap their
//! network waits. That matters: a page load fans out a dozen endpoint calls,
//! and serializing them would give back far more than the hop this removes.
//!
//! The isolate is created lazily on first use. Construction performs a one-time
//! handshake with Netease when its persisted state is cold, and there is no
//! reason to pay that at startup for a session that never leaves the remote
//! transport.
//!
//! See `docs/native-ncm-api-embedding-plan.md`.
