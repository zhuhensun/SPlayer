/**
 * Process-scoped owner of the OS media session.
 *
 * Everything durable lives here rather than on [MediaSessionPlugin] because a
 * Tauri plugin instance does not outlive the Activity in the way the session
 * has to. Tauri's `PluginManager` is a process-scoped object that constructs
 * each plugin exactly once and never replaces it, but it still forwards
 * `onDestroy` when the Activity goes away — so an Activity recreation used to
 * run the plugin's teardown with no matching setup afterwards. That left the
 * notification cancelled, the session released and the action channel dropped,
 * permanently, while the Rust process kept playing.
 *
 * That is not a hypothetical: `MainActivity.installRenderProcessGuard` calls
 * `recreate()` on purpose when the WebView render process dies, precisely so
 * playback survives.
 *
 * All entry points are main-thread only. Tauri dispatches `@Command` methods
 * there, the foreground service's callbacks run there, and the artwork thread
 * hops back through [mainHandler].
