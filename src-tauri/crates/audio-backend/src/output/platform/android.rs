    // large real-time callback, which is more vulnerable to CPU-pressure
    // deadline misses. The preallocated 48-block rings and player prebuffer
    // remain the scheduler-jitter safety margin outside the callback.

    // That tuning only grows `buffer_size_in_frames` up to the stream's
    // *capacity*, which is why this crate does not enable CPAL's `realtime`
    // feature for Android: it would open the stream in
    // AAUDIO_PERFORMANCE_MODE_LOW_LATENCY, where the capacity is a couple of
    // bursts and the self-healing has almost nothing to grow into. See the
    // `cpal` tables in Cargo.toml.
