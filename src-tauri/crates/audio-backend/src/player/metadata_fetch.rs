//! Backend-side track metadata hydration.
//!
//! The backend advances tracks on its own, and on Android it does so while the
//! WebView is destroyed. Until now the *display* half of that still came from
//! JS: the frontend fetched song details and pushed them into the manifest. So
//! when the WebView died, tracks the planner moved to had no title, artist or
//! artwork — the media session fell back to whatever the decoder could read,
//! which for a Netease CDN stream is a content hash.
//!
//! This module closes that gap by fetching `/song/detail` through the embedded
//! protocol layer (`ncm-core`, reached via `source_resolver`'s `NcmCallHook`).
//! Same seam as URL resolution, same reason: this crate also builds for
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, so it cannot depend on the isolate directly.
//!
//! Scheduling mirrors the one-ahead resolver: the fetch runs on
//! `spawn_blocking` and reports back through a channel, so the player loop
//! never waits on the network and nothing here runs near an audio callback.
//!
//! Secrets: the cookie is forwarded so entitlement-sensitive fields match what
//! the user would see, and is never logged.
