//! Playback planner: owns the cursor, traversal order, failure policy and the

//! playable source.
//!
//! The planner walks `ManifestStore::order()` positionally, in every mode.
//! Random mode is not a per-hop dice roll and not a permutation the planner
//! maintains either: the frontend shuffles the *playlist* and publishes it in
//! that order, so one pass covers every track exactly once and a hop is always
//! "the next slot". That is what lets random mode advance indefinitely with the

//! a WebView restart from restarting the pass and replaying tracks.
//!
//! All state here is plain data on the player's control path — no allocation
