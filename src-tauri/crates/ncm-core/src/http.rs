//! HTTP transport for the protocol layer.
//!
//! Async on purpose. The JS side issues one request per endpoint call, and a
//! page load fans out a dozen of those; with a blocking client a single isolate
//! can only have one request in flight, so those calls serialize and the whole
//! point of removing the proxy hop is lost. Awaiting instead lets the isolate
//! run other jobs while a response is outstanding.
//!
//! `reqwest` rather than a standalone client because hyper/reqwest is already
//! linked into the app through `tauri-plugin-http` and `tauri` itself — this
//! adds no new stack.
//!
//! ## The transport is HTTP/2, and used to be so by accident
//!
//! Both Netease hosts negotiate `h2`. That contradicts what this module used to
//! say, and the way it was wrong is worth keeping: this crate did not declare
//! reqwest's `http2` feature, so its client never offered `h2` in ALPN and was
//! handed back the only thing it asked for. `tauri-plugin-http` *does* declare
//! that feature on the same reqwest version, and Cargo unifies features across
//! a build — so the shipped app has been on HTTP/2 while `cargo test -p
//! ncm-core`, which builds this crate alone, measured HTTP/1.1. Every constant
//! below was tuned against a transport the app does not use.
//!
//! The feature is now declared here, so the two agree — and note the tree
//! carries *two* reqwests (0.12 here and under `tauri-plugin-http`, 0.13 under
//! `tauri-plugin-updater`). Different majors do not unify, so the inherited
//! `http2` was one dependency bump away from silently reverting this crate to
//! HTTP/1.1 with no build error and no failing test.
//! `tests/live_transport.rs` holds the measurements and asserts the negotiated
//! version, so it is a property of the wire rather than of the build graph.
//!
//! The lesson worth more than the fix: a measurement that contradicts a
//! documented capability is far more likely to be measuring the *client*.
//! `openssl s_client -alpn h2,http/1.1 -connect music.163.com:443` answers it
//! in one line, independently of anything Rust is doing, and confirms `h2` on
//! both hosts.
//!
//! **Declaring the feature is the fix; h2 being faster is not the reason.** On
//! the path this was measured from, h1 was in fact the quicker of the two for a
//! burst — cold *and* warm (`tests/live_transport::burst_cost_cold_and_warm`,
//! 12 concurrent: 36 ms h1 vs 47 ms h2 warm on `music.163.com`, 49 vs 62 on
//! `interface3`). Cold that is expected, since twelve h1 connections handshake
//! concurrently and get an `initcwnd` each where h2 queues them behind one
//! handshake and one congestion window. Warm it is not, and the honest reading
//! is that these numbers are the local path's — a VPN or TUN-mode proxy relays
//! ALPN unchanged but owns every millisecond — so they are not evidence for
//! either protocol. What the change rests on instead:
//!
//! * **Reproducibility.** A crate whose wire protocol depends on what a sibling
//!   crate happens to enable cannot be measured, and every constant below was
//!   tuned against a transport the app does not run.
//! * **Connection reuse stopped being a compromise**, which is the real win, and
//!   it is a same-path *relative* comparison rather than an absolute — see
//!   [`POOL_IDLE_TIMEOUT`].
//! * **A dead connection got more expensive**, which is the real cost — see
//!   [`H2_KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL`].
//!
//! HTTP/3 is not on offer, despite a header that reads like it is.
//! `interface3.music.163.com` intermittently answers
//! `alt-svc: quic=":443"; ma=2592000; v="44,43,39"` — that is *gQUIC*, Google's
//! pre-standard QUIC, frozen around 2018, and not something an RFC 9114 client
//! can speak; a real offer would name `h3`. It is intermittent because these are
//! anycast CDN edges and they are not configured alike: repeated runs get the
//! header on one request and nothing on the next.
//! `tests/live_transport::no_http3_is_advertised` keys on `h3` for exactly that
//! reason — absence proves nothing here, so it is written as a tripwire for the
//! one reading that would change a decision rather than as a measurement.
//!
//! The failure that the timeout shape exists to prevent: a request written into
//! a socket the peer has silently dropped produces neither a response nor an
//! error. It hangs. Without a per-attempt ceiling it hangs for the entire call
//! budget and then surfaces as `transport error (timeout)`, which upstream
//! `util/request.js` reports as a 502 — a failure the user sees, invented
//! entirely on this side of the socket.
//!
//! ## Bursts
//!
//! Fanning a dozen calls out at once is also how a client gets rate limited,
//! and Netease's answer to a burst is usually a refused or reset connection
//! rather than a 429 — which surfaces as `transport error (…)`, becomes a
//! rejected axios promise, and is finally reported by upstream
//! `util/request.js` as `{ status: 502, code: 502 }`. That 502 is ours, not
//! theirs. [`crate::throttle`] shapes the outbound traffic so the burst stays
//! inside what the service tolerates, and the retry loop below resends only the
//! failures that provably never reached an origin.
