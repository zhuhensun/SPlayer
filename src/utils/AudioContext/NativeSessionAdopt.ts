/**
 * NativeSessionAdopt — reconcile the frontend with a backend that is already
 * playing, before the frontend commits to loading anything.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * On Android the WebView is destroyed and the page reloaded (Activity teardown
 * under memory pressure) while the Rust process — and playback — keeps running.
 * The reloaded frontend rehydrates Pinia from persisted storage, which
 * describes the track that was playing when the app was *backgrounded*, not
 * what is playing now. Without this step the boot path would:
 *
 *   1. resolve a fresh CDN URL for the stale persisted track,
 *   2. fail the existing `allowInitialBackendAttach` check — that compares
 *      `local:<url>` ids, and the URL is re-resolved with a new token every
 *      session, so it can never match,
 *   3. `SetPlaylist` + play the stale track, cutting off live audio, and
 *   4. publish a manifest whose `cursorIdentity` is the stale track, dragging
 *      the planner cursor backwards too (revisions are monotonic across
 *      reloads, so the backend accepts it).
 *
 * i.e. playback visibly rewinds to wherever it was when the app went to the
 * background. Asking the backend first — and matching on `TrackIdentity`, the
 * only key that survives URL re-resolution — turns that into an adoption.
 *
 * Tauri-only. Everywhere else the JS runtime and the audio host share a
 * lifetime, so there is nothing to reconcile.
