/**
 * NativeSessionControlsSync — the frontend's half of the session-controls
 * subscription.
 *
 * Play mode and "favourite" are shown on three surfaces (the app, the OS
 * notification, the lock screen) and settable from all of them. Three writers
 * for one value is how they drift, so there is exactly one copy and it lives in
 * the backend — see `player/session_controls.rs`. This module is the frontend's
 * end of that contract, and it does two things and nothing else:
 *
 * - **publish** what the frontend knows. Play mode is a persisted setting the UI
 *   owns; the like state comes from the account's likelist, which only the
 *   frontend fetches. Both are pushed as a patch, so neither claims the other.
 * - **adopt** what the backend reports. A `sessionControlsChanged` is the
 *   authority — including for a change this frontend asked for, which is what
 *   makes the OS button and the in-app button behave identically.
 *
 * Adoption deliberately does *not* re-publish: the backend only emits on a real
 * change, so adopting is a fixed point. Writing the store here and letting its
 * own watchers publish would be an infinite round trip.
 *
 * Tauri-only. On the web the page is the only surface, so it owns both values
 * directly and there is nothing to reconcile.
